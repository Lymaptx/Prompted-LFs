exceptionally vulgar but not particularly original entertaining or funny ways the show s consistently weak writing often consists of little more than recording bush cheney jokes heard elsewhere ad

rely on the same old bush jokes over and over again the show might be considered somewhat tolerable and possibly even innovative ultimately it is difficult to ascertain which shortcoming causes the lil bush series the most damage its clear lack of originality and weak writing quality or its painfully narrow minded ambitions it is reasonable to expect that lil bush will be able to maintain a small base of left wing fans that is if they are able to endure the exceptionally poor writing so long as the program continues to lampoon the bush administration thoroughly even so the majority of

for hitting every character and every social segment of new york city over the head his response was a denial after all he lived in new york himself and belonged to a neighborhood improvement committee and other admirable organizations exactly the qualifications one would want on his resume in order to deny that he disliked new yorkers wolfe has a phd in american studies from yale and is no dummy those supposed weaknesses are what made the novel memorable nobody was any good and sherman mccoy wound up broke a professional protester for social justice the movie throws all of that away and imposes a moral frame on the story that simply doesn t fit wolfe did his homework the novel was rooted in reality every event was not only possible but thoroughly believable wolfe might have made a great cultural anthropologist he knows how to get inside a system and record its details yes any of us might have found ourselves as sherman and his mistress do stuck in the south bronx threatened by a couple of black kids and making a getaway after bumping into one of them that scene is transferred neatly from print to celluloid but after that scene the movie seems not to trust its audience and at times become frantic in its attempt to spell out its message however nebulous the message is sherman might accidentally hit some kid and be arrested for it as he is in the novel but he would not immediately upon his release from jail go back to his phenomenally expensive condo take out a shotgun and start shooting into the ceiling with it as he does in the movee in what s supposed to be a funny scene ceiling plaster falls all over the party guests and they scurry away shrieking it simply would not have happened the movie has left the novel s unspeakably detailed reality in the dust wolfe s sensibility the work he put into capturing the real has been lost what we get instead is a noisy fantastic and silly scene that doesn t do anything except wake the audience up similar empty scenes follow screaming out for wolfe s verisimilitude the movie also fails because it thrusts a lot of sin and redemption into an entertaining story of moral nihilism here we see don juan in hell at the opera we get lectures on redemption from a poet with aids we see a lot of guilt in sherman a black judge who preaches from the bench and gives one of those final speeches about how we all have to start behaving nicely again a reporter who feels sorry for sherman after turning him into a sacrificial lamb and a happy ending in which sherman gets off by breaking the law with an idiotic grin the

kicks a gun in half kicks a guy so hard what looks like his dentures fall out and of course chopping the bottle scene give me a break not to mention the fact that it s very hard to tell what happens in the fights because it s filmed so poorly one part that was amusing was when he broke the guys arm through the door giving him a compound fracture ok as the action goes on we are treated to gobs of

occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not instead of running the country the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead and up to the last moment the country was up in arms the prime minister making speeches every newspaper writing about it everyone in the country holding their breaths and the network pushed on towards a new frontier in television and they definitely succeeded in doing just that they pushed the envelope the show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he

kidney auction the whole show that with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions built up for months to a fantastic climax was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of

see several of the different tribes of all kinds including pygmies called dwarfs in the movie since this movie was made almost years ago i can t knock any of the realism because they didn t have it in the movies that long ago they do the best they can so you put up with actors talking in front of fake backgrounds however weissmuller did a lot of action scenes and was in great shape he and o sullivan make a well built handsome couple if there ever was one in those golden years of cinema the film has historical value with so many sequels in that it shows how tarzan acquired jane and his beginnings of learning the english language the bad from the moment jane parker is taken by tarzan almost every scene with her is maureen o sullivan in hysterics shrieking and screaming scene after scene it s enough to give you a headache and it ruins the film thankfully she calmed down in the sequels but not in this movie the movie also does no favors for the great white hunter image as c aubrey smith playing jane s father and neil hamilton as harry holt the safari guide shoot at every animal within sight whether the beasts is threatening or not these people are kill happy particularly smith on another note it s too bad there isn t anything in here explaining how tarzan got to be in the jungle in the first place there is no history of him in here or footage of his growing up he s

of that week s release this movie takes the whole based off of fact thing too far this movie wasn t complete crap i must admit it held my interest and micheal keaton was believable as a man searching

it was a movie experience i ll never forget a timeless story of the bored farm boy who just knows he was meant for more saving the princess and the galaxy from the evil menace while being mentored by the wise wizard the rogue pirate and the various comic relief all in a space opera setting and that s not to chastise lucas for using an old formula it s an old formula precisely because it works and to his credit he gave it new twists that made it very special then came empire and the story became more than just a fairy tale darkness entered the picture and we learned one of the great movie twists of all time the great villain vader was luke s father wow no one saw that coming of course i m convinced neither did lucas till it showed up in the screenplay go back and watch star wars again knowing what you know now particularly in light of the first three episodes see if it really meshes which brings me to the problem i have revenge is an entertaining movie tremendous effects plenty of action some good fighting scenes but a movie still lives or dies on its plot the story it is telling oh certainly really good acting can save a weak plot but a weak plot coupled with bad acting that s a burden no director can overcome certainly not one as bad as i m forced to realize george lucas is the man has managed to direct some of the worst performances in their careers from some very fine actors liam neeson natalie portman samuel jackson spoilers ahead the plot oh my understand he s already handicapped by what s happened in the first two films so it s an incredible burden one too much for him to overcome first we have the sheer absurdities of the background we have anakin being found as a child on tatooine the product of a virginal miracle birth the chosen one well this detail never gets remotely explained indeed the closest explanation is yoda s observation that maybe they were wrong oh well okay then our mistake now this same wunderkind turns out to be the creator of c po hey what a coincidence that is and he ll come back to tatooine and never know he was from there wow how about that testing the old willing suspension of disbelief there eh george anyway we have this bratty kid moody petulant whining young adult who must somehow become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history the great tragedy of darth vador the good guy who falls from grace only to finally achieve redemption in the end how pray tell does this happen why he has a dream that his wife will die in childbirth now sure he lives in a star spanning civilization that treats gravity like we treat gasoline but does it occur to the dark one to be to maybe check with a physician cause maybe just maybe this futuristic society might can do something about this problem why no the only thing he can think to do is go kill some children because the bad guy at the root of all the evil they ve been chasing for two films tells him that he s got the secret to immortality well of course he does sheesh how can lucas expect us to watch such foolishness and be moved by it how can anyone expect us to care hell why would anyone want this brat to be saved or redeemed in the first place i wanted kenobi to kill him not because he was evil but because he was pathetically stupid oh by the way amidala finally dies in childbirth why well they don t know the doctor who is a droid and himself indicative of the incredibly high technology to which this society has advanced offers only the conclusion of she s lost the will to live well oh okay of course she has maybe it finally dawned on her what a dweeb she was sleeping with but here we are we have kenobi present for all this he knows of the birth of luke and leia knows who their father is and knows what happens to them knows also the role of both r and c po and yet in several years as luke approaches manhood and shows up with po and r curiously po s mind is wiped but not r s why stating i think these droids belong to you kenobi who knows that the protocol droid was constructed by the one he believed to be the chosen one and apprentice to the emperor himself and who just happened to be built on this very planet says strange i don t recall owning any droids oh good grief lucas simply made this up as he went along once he introduced vader as luke s father sadly the story began spinning out of control because he didn t know what the story was the plot of episodes is simply incomprehensible nothing palpatine did made any rational sense at all and none of this ties into the story he originally told in star wars it s an

even that bad actually if nothing else at least it obeys the admittedly unwritten first rule of s slasher kill someone within the first minutes of playtime sure you ve heard about the basic premise of this film a dozen times before but don t let that discourage you from watching it as the forest has a couple of things more to offer than just an appealingly sinister cover image it s actually a bit of an atypical s slasher the main characters aren t ordinary brainless teenagers and the script has solid ambitions towards supernaturalism the concept isn t always successful let alone plausible but it s more than interesting enough to hold your attention and there are even are a couple of surprisingly strong moments of tension and plot twists to enjoy two married couples decide to go camping in the most isolated woods of california but due to a stupid bet the wives travel separately from their husbands barely set up for the night they receive uncanny visits from a mother looking for her two children the children themselves and finally the father who s out hunting for human flesh the demented family may be real or imaginary but the women are definitely in danger and by the time their

be to enjoy this odd viewing experience for as long as it lasts and not a minute longer the acting performances are just above average the music is okay and at least director donald jones also

her ghostly young friends to potential safety they even at one point plead with their father to not kill her charlie unfortunately doesn t have such friends director donald jones who also wrote it and went broke funding the film smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking gorgeous location in the sequoia national park in california where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights and i basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose for some strange reason i didn t particularly find jones direction of the setting very atmospheric the dread was missing although there are some rather disturbing attacks by john using his knife shot in a clever way jones camera suggests more than what is actually on screen yet somehow still achieves that gasp at what john is doing to victims within such a picturesque landscape to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac that kind of increases the terror city folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place to smell the clean fresh air enjoy the sights of a lovely view only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife providing the back story to why john is the monster he is jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife s adultery and reacting accordingly she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children wishing to punish them for being naughty killing both her and the lover in bed a refrigerator repairman the children sad and depressed committed suicide and now haunt the wilderness still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose i realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some but i found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious they do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably the music i found hideously s and the performances aren t mind blowing i mean i could react to the situation they were in because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well i think the film is similar in many ways to don t go into the woods alone except that the forest has the aforementioned ghost children their voices echo when talking to sharon their father or each other gary kent looks like a filthy george lucas with tattered clothes and humanity lost as i mentioned above the violence isn t as grisly as what is suggested because director jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled such as teddi s murder the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone

absolute most redundant horror movies ever made part two didn t have an actual plot and re used footage of the original only to further exploit the success of the genuinely gritty and petrifying premise craven also wanted us to believe even dogs suffer from flashbacks and painful memories as the loyal german shepard of the carter family re experienced his bloody fight with one of the mountain hillbillies there were quite a bit of alarming signs indicating us that this sequel would be a horrendous failure as well the remake came out barely one year ago and here s the sequel already the incredible speed of its release righteously causes you to question the quality of the script don t they need a little more time if they want to come up with a film that should be scary menacing and disturbing with his excellent film alexandre aja nearly single handedly altered the general opinion about horror remakes as he had the courage and intellect of changing essential elements in the plot and adding more nauseating gore than anyone could ever had hoped for also aja is quite a talented young director and made himself noticed with his french instant cult classic high tension but who is this new director aja s the hills have eyes was an unexpected hit appreciated by both experienced and older generations of horror fans as well as the younger and over enthusiast target groups it s a really good film and even though an avalanche of new sequels and clones will be inevitable it s highly unlikely that one of them will ever equal the surprising quality level of aja s smashing hit bearing all this in mind plus a rather large dose of personal skepticism i must admit this rushed sequel really isn t as awful as anticipated the screenplay is routine and clich d horror fodder introducing a fairly large number of characters with few or even no backbone and tastelessly depicting how they get slaughtered by traditionally repulsive looking freaks after the events of the first film the us army has set up a camp in the middle of the new mexican desert to investigate the effects of the nuclear tests which took place there in the s and s for the horribly mutated survivors of the miner s community that stayed there during the radioactive testing the scientists and researchers form a tasty starter until the main course of incompetent soldiers arrives by truck they are just supposed to drop off food and supplies but encounter their ultimate military training exercise when faced with the relentless humanoids that live inside the remainders of the mines this basically is just another by the numbers slasher with dumb characters who are even after losing several of their friends already still stupid enough to separate themselves from the group and act like easy targets to kill it s also very easy to point out which ones will make it out of this adventure alive especially when one of the soldiers is against all types of violence and another one continuously stares at video images of her cute year old son the hills have eyes ii completely lacks as to be expected originality logic and plausible situations the mutated miners aren t nearly as menacing as their colleagues in part one mainly because they aren t organized this time and only just behave like drooling and sex hungry prototype monsters since you don t care for the amateur g i joe heroes and definitely don t feel any sympathy for the eyes in the hills this film is a whole lot less compelling and involving than last year s original most peculiarly this second film isn t nearly as violent and gory as the first sequels usually compensate the lack of suspense and the absence of surprise twists with extra bloodshed and more graphic killing sequences but the action in this sequel is really tame compared to the sick footage featuring in its predecessor there are a handful of scenes to satisfy the bloodthirsty horror fanatics mainly showing soldiers falling down cliffs or getting shot by their own guns but there sadly aren t any outrageous pick axe battles or virulent dog attacks what a shame what s the point of a sequel if it even fails to surpass the level of grossness and or gratuitous filth of the original luckily enough the film is never boring or unnecessarily sentimental and you ll have the most fun spotting all the things that don t make the slightest bit of sense

"dreamgirls despite its fistful of tony wins in an incredibly weak year on broadway has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals however that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on screen unfortunately what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact first the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor there are lots of songs perhaps too many but few of them are especially memorable the closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and one night only the much acclaimed and i am telling you that i am not going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of effie jennifer hudson the film is slick and technically well produced but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance there is some interest in the opening moments watching jamie foxx s svengali like manager manipulate his acts to the top but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain despite his having been right from a business stand point for a good majority of the film beyonce knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz anika noni rose as the third member of the dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film eddie murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on james brown but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact foxx would seem ideal casting but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored the film s biggest selling point is surely former american idol contestant oscar winner jennifer hudson in the central role of effie white the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return for me effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie the film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham handedly takes her side but i have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion from the start effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious egotistical self centered diva who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part when she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude the charges are more than well founded but the stage show film seem to think effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice even though the film tries to soften some of effie s harder edges to make her more likable the charges still stand her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter using the implication that much like the talent card motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable indeed the only big effort the film makes to show effie s mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office insists that the girl has no father and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows in the hands of a skillful actress the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma unfortunately hudson is not that actress she sings well but the dialog driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments effie s signature moment the aforementioned and i am telling you number is well sung by hudson but emotionally flat in the acting department effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament but hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number all in all not quite the emotional highlight one expects the latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver foxx into hudson s earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone foxx s criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers but the film s seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous not to mention pretentious and condescending particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle the end result is a faithful rendition of the stage

a brokeback mountain from the s and we thought this was a new idea gary cooper s character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep cooper clear of females this misogyny alone doesn t necessarily mean much but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple in

for someone who is relatively fluent the voice interpretation of matlin s dialogue under the excuse that hurt s character likes the sound of his voice turns her more and more into a weird distant object as the film goes on matlin does shine in the few scenes where her signing is not partially hidden from view but nonetheless most of the movie when this is a love story is only showed from a single point of view that of the man as ebert said if a story is about the battle of two people over the common ground on which they will communicate it s not fair to make the whole movie on the terms of only one of them the idea that an oralist teacher who uses methods that have been imposed in many deaf schools for decades would be presented as revolutionary is fairly insulting in itself his character becomes weakened as a credible teacher as the movie goes on drawing comedy from a deaf accent is quite honestly rather low and his attitude towards the male students of his class is pretty symptomatic of how he seems to act with women as an entitled man a party scene involving a number of deaf people including a few academics meeting together leaves him seemingly isolated in a way that s fairly inconsistent with his credentials i have seen interpreters spontaneously switch to asl between each other even when they weren t aware of a deaf person being in the area and yet somehow he

faints next we catch up with lex luthor in a scene about many murky close ups of an old lady as she dies we don t see luthor s face until the end of the scene an early instance of the film s drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned lex luthor is a guy who doesn t like superman because he is not human also he probably doesn t like humans either as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot

returns so i excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry it still took about another half hour before things went wrong for space shuttle lane when they did

reasoning and do so in that of late fashionably rapid filming style we have the documentary laced hand held camera moving everywhere despite never leaving the van and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out lately you kind of get use to it but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating keeping it still will help the context has little groundwork which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads at a road side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied suv headlight scared they flee and not too long that one light suv appears behind them soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror spending most of the time playing out a drawn out noisy and relentless cat and mouse game as for being disturbing i guess that depends some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain desperation and demented brutality with good use of piercing sound fx that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects but also i found myself snickering too in passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush but hardly believable the injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe despite obviously they should be watch how blood runs freely but it s not entirely convincing and can get dull the constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive we get screaming spewing bleeding running cursing body fluids and so on quite unpleasant details followed too with little really to do it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up too many cringe moments arose from it and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in it was about set pieces waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern the performances jennifer barnett angela brunda danielle lilley sandra paduch and mia yi are workman like with their distraught characters and

returns here as harry s partner just to name a few harry callahan is still at odds with the higher ups in the department still mean still tough but now he s older and wearier his constant conflicts with his superiors are a metaphor for his inner conflict a respect and reverence for the law versus a desire to serve the pure spirit of justice the two things not always being compatible this incompatibility is the underlying theme of the series the first film posed a simple question what about the victim s rights do they outweigh those of the criminal vice versa depends that film s answer was controversial prompting a sequel the highly enjoyable magnum force which set out to draw the line between harry s brand of justice and pure heartless vigilantism dirty harry like many of clint s other roles is the personification of vengeance the protector of the the defenseless this movie however brings it back to the victim in this case jennifer portrayed by sondra locke who decides to avenge the rape of herself and her now incapacitated sister by ruthlessly hunting down and ritualistically executing the men and one woman who committed the crime without going into a play by play of the whole movie i will say this i mentioned earlier that sudden impact echoes the first film it actually also sprinkles in little references and in jokes from the whole series the confusion concerning

vigilante or a victim justifiably standing up for her and her sister s tarnished rights the exchange between these two at the very end of the film is a poetic denouement of the series one which i personally as a fan found quite moving that last scene alone makes sudden impact the legitimate climax to the dirty harry collection the perfect answer to the conflict posed in the first film not to

the fighting though things aren t as rousing as they could be shintaro katsu turns in a typical bravura performance as zatoichi mixing wisdom deadly skill and worldliness with a subtly sad sense of vulnerability while solid work comes also from rentar mikuni and an effectively baleful k nishimura later to appear as katsu s superior snake magobei in the hanzo trilogy as the two main bosses in the film there is also a good emotional turn from yuko hamada as a wronged woman the film loses out through shaky pacing and a not so well constructed sequence of events there is at least one slightly jarring time jump and the power of the plot becomes a little lost meaning that when things heat up towards the end the film isn t as exciting as it could be emotional impact is lost also the action or scenes of zatoichi using his ingenious skills are well handled by director satsuo yamamoto though some of the gambling is less interesting and the film builds up in a workmanlike rather than really inspired way without the lively characters or strong verve of some other installments still i enjoyed this one it has its flaws and isn t one of the best of the series but it still packs a sweetly satisfying dose of entertainment a good story and decent doses of zatoichi s trademark ingenious and quirky cool recommended for fans of the series and a reasonable entry point classy stuff though not

father of the family has to take a new job in san francisco the pets believing that they have been abandoned escape and set out on a long homeward journey through wilderness this story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon but both versions are in fact live action films made using real animals one major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices giving each its own distinct personality something that was not done in the original film a similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children s films such as racing stripes some critics have been rather sniffy about the use of this device but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to strengthen the film rather than weaken it the animals were voiced by big name stars don ameche michael j fox and sally fields both dogs are male and their relationship parallels that between many humans in buddy buddy movies shadow a golden retriever is the wise experienced older dog chance the younger one is brash cocky and impulsive to british eyes chance looks like a boxer but is actually an american bulldog which is apparently a different breed to its british cousin sassy the cat is female with a rather prim and proper personality she is very proud of her status as a cat which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog cats rule dogs drool from an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults it can be sentimental some of the incidents such as the one in which the animals manage to catapult a mountain lion into the river are quite incredible and the human characters are all completely forgettable this however is a film which is mainly aimed at children and i suspect they will enjoy it immensely certainly any animal loving child will do so comments by some professional critics such as james berardinelli who complained that the animals voices lessened the film s grandeur only serve to strengthen my view that professional critics are not always the best guides to children s movies i doubt if many playground conversations about homeward bound concentrated on its supposed grandeur one thing adults will appreciate is the photography of california s sierra nevada mountains they may also appreciate the film s blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter perils such as bears mountain

but it was the most unique and the most iconic the lovers on the bridge was the first of his full length features i ve seen a virtuoso romantic film that uses image and music to communicate an exuberant young love that overflows into the poetic though he s classified as a neo nouvelle vogue his films owe as much to silent cinema as the s experimental narratives his movies are closer to jean vigo in l atlante jean cocteau and guy maddin than godard and truffaut in boy meets girl carax s debut he uses black and white and the heavy reliance on visual representation to display emotional states he combines the exaggerated worlds of maddin but based in a reality that never seems quite stable like cocteau but by virtue of its expressions it becomes more accessible emotional and engaging like vigo s movies the story of boy meets girl is simple and similar to carax s two following films which comprise this young lovers trilogy a boy named alex played by denis lavant who plays a character named alex in carax s next two movies has just been dumped by his girlfriend who has fallen in love with his best friend in the first scene he nearly kills his friend on a boardwalk but stops short of murder he walks around reminded of her by sounds of his neighbors having sex and daydreams of his girlfriend and best friend getting intimate he steals records for her and leaves them at his friend s apartment but avoids contacting either of them directly he wanders around and finds his way to a party where he meets a suicidal young woman and the film becomes part breathless and part limelight later he is advised by an old man with sign language to speak up for yourself young people today it s like they forgot how to talk the old man gives an anecdote about working in the days of silent film and how an actor timid off stage became a confident lion when in front of the camera heres where the movie tips its hand but the overt reference to silent film is a crucial scene since it overlaps the style of the film silent and expressionist with the content a lovelorn young man trying to work up the courage to say and do the things he really wants to though alex is pensive at first and a torrent of romantic words tumbling out of him by the end he is the shy actor who becomes a lion thanks to the films magnification of his inward feelings which aren t easy to nail down from moment to moment aside from a desire to fall in love there is a scene in the film where alex retreats from the party into a room where the guests have stashed their children and babies all crying in a chorus that fills that room until he turns on a tape of a children s show making them fall silent unexpectedly due a glitch the tv ends up playing a secret bathroom camera which reveals the hostess sobbing to herself into her wig about someone she misses even as carax is self reflexive and self deprecating of the very kind of angst ridden coming of age tale he is trying to tell the room full of whining infants he s mature enough to see through the initial irony to the lovelorn in everything the film crosses even the rich old bell of the ball has a brother she misses in another scene an ex astronaut stares at the moon he once walked on in his youth while sipping a cocktail in silence though indebted to films before talkies carax is a master of music knowing when to pipe in the dead kennedy s holiday in cambodia or an early david bowie song the sounds of a man playing piano or of a girl softly humming in boy meets girl when someone gets their heart broken we see blood pour from their shirt when a couple kiss on the sidewalk they spin degrees as if attached to a carousel when alex enters a party an feels out of place its because the most interesting people in the world really are in attendance like the famous author who can t speak because of a bullet lodged in his brain or the miss universe of standing just across from the astronaut this film is the missing link between jean piere jenuet michel gondry and wes anderson whose stylistic flourishes and quirky tales of whimsy all have a parallel with different visuals musical and emotional cues in these carax movies every line of dialog every piece of music and every effect and edit in this movie resonated with me on some emotional level some i lack words to articulate there are many tales of a boy meeting a girl but rather than just explore the banal details of any particular event this movie captures the ecstatic truth of adolescent passion and disappointment the other movies you want to watch can

it can mean to someone brokedown palace is a very good film it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about but first i want to say what is good about the film and for starters the acting is top notch and you can look no further than the two leads danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges but she seems more fun than darlene but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of alice s bill pullman is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand the film is photographed very well also the inside of the prison while not the same as shawshank or natural born killers or return to paradice but it does show the necessary but underdone hopelessness of the situation that they are in johnathin kaplan s direction is quite good as well we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day brokedown palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do we have it easy compared to some country s and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject some of the music is done by a group called delirium i think but it is sara mclaughlin wrong spelling but how do you spell her last name that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film what i didn t enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit i won t say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you ll know what i am talking about also i didn t really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic but i didn t get that here overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question how far would you go for a friend that is a tough question and maybe one that

fantasies and paul is a coarse unkempt sleazy guy who is not impressed with being a clerk their concepts change rather quickly when paul salvages carla s job by filling her request to steal a letter

them back to ant island and introduces them he learns that they are actually not warriors but circus bugs the main reason why this second pixar feature has never absolutely astounded me might be the

however an interesting fact this entry was only one in series to not have it set entirely in san francisco the story follows that of detective callahan trying to put the pieces together of a murder where the victim was shot in the groin and then between the eyes after getting in some trouble with office superiors and causing a stir which has some crime lord thugs after his blood he s ordered to

probably being on par with the first sequel magnum force this well assembled plot actually gives eastwood another angle to work upon even though it feels more like a sophisticated take on the vigilante features running rampant at that time quite literal with something punishing but luridly damaging it s like he s experimenting with noir thriller touches with character driven traits to help develop the emotionally bubbling and eventual morality framework his use of images is lasting due to its slickly foreboding atmospherics dark tones brooding lighting like the scene towards the end akin to some western showdown of a silhouette figure harry with his new automag handgun moving its way towards the stunned prey on the fishing docks it s a striking sight that builds fear mixing the hauntingly cold with plain brutality and dash of humor it seemed to come off a major plus with these films are the dialogues while i wouldn t call sudden impact first rate it provides ample biting exchanges and memorably creditable lines you re a legend in your own mind don t you just love hearing harry sparking an amusing quip before pulling out his piece the beating action when it occurs is excitingly jarring and intense the only way to go and the pacing flies by with little in the way of flat passages lalo schfrin would return as composer after the enforcer had jerry fielding scoring bringing a methodical funky kick which still breathed those gloomy cues to a texturally breezy score that clicked from the get go bruce surtees an eastwood regular gets the job behind the camera where he did a piecing job with dirty harry and gives the film plenty of scope by wonderfully framing the backdrops in some impeccable tracking scenes but also instrument edgy angles within those dramatic moments eastwood as the dinosaur callahan still packs a punch going beyond just that steely glare to get the job done and probably showing a little more heart than one would expect from a younger callahan this going by the sudden shift in a plot turn of harry s quest for justice by the badge even though he doesn t always agree with it i just found it odd a real change of heart across from him

the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy this could be slightly misleading as it is not a hilarious film nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense but it does have light hearted moments much as life itself there are also moments of sadness too it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above and nudity runs throughout the length of film the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal and concentrate on the plot not the copious amount of flesh simon and marcie michael allen and eliza lovell arrive by car at a beach side car park they take their belongings to the beach and while they are walking a voice over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is the rest of the film is an exploration of this framed by one complete day at the beach the basic story is of what happens to simon s love life but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes when they arrive at the beach both simon and marcie appear bored with each other marcie sees them as a romeo and juliet romantic couple simon is just bored with it all next we are introduced to gail bonnie jaye lawrence paula zara collins and jenny jennifer ross they are walking down the beach together discussing gail s chances of finding the perfect man aided by the powers of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother however there are many more interesting people on the beach not all of them attractive and young part of the realism of this film to service the beach s patrons there is a flatulent short sighted ice cream salesperson with a van this is ben gary waddell who is a friend of simon and is also his unofficial counsellor i would think that this character is the main comic element it is hard to say though as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud unless you were intoxicated male and very young maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject as the quality of acting is variable the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap the lack of continuity is a positive boon in fact there is something about this film not the nudity that i find appealing it is hard to define what it is but it could be something to do with its bluntness and downright aussie attitude to carnal matters the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention sometimes it is very good with some stunning static shots and pans of the beach cliffs and a sunset as nudity is a major factor in this film framing is an important aspect of the camera work there is no sense of gratuity in the framing meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on private body parts this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject s personal space and makes the film more tasteful not an easy task given the location for filming maslin beach is neither a skin flick for post pubescent testosterone charged males nor a mills and boon romance for under appreciated women maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre the actors are not attractive in the baywatch sense and are just normal people that you would see on the beach anywhere it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement other than perhaps to naturists apart from the australian accent the filming could have been in any sunny country what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless cinema verite and only australian cinema and other medium sized national cinemas could consider such a rash option at the same time these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity and a flop is not going to damage their reputation too much it is always possible given that maslin beach is now a collector s item that the film might become internationally popular but it is very unlikely during this critique i have been sounding highly negative at times about maslin beach this is not the real position as i found the film very easy to watch i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people and problems the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday and a little low on spectacle this does it no harm in my view and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe and with french film in particular they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes but with the everyday hollywood is in direct opposition to this and rides the crest of the hyper real action drama angst wave the pace too is much faster in hollywood but it is not reality maslin beach is not exactly jacques tati either but it is on the right track even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism equality gender orientation and so on that are of such importance in current cinema i am

half of the actual poem is a lot sloppier and a lot harder to tread through until that is you get to the climactic battle scenes only the iliad s are better lang and harbou embellished the huns the poet compiler of the nibelungenlied didn t know a hun from his right ball and as a result they are more or less the same as the burgundians in custom for example although the poet clearly describes etzel as a heathen which is kriemhild s main concern as rudiger tries to persuade her to marry him when she gets to hunland the first thing she does is go to mass the huns here are clearly heathens they re almost like caveman the depiction of them is hilarious especially verbal the jester who has two marvelous scenes etzel s character has been given more weight he is much more formidable all he does is bemoan his fate in the original poem lang and harbou are masterful at building suspense especially at the banquet scene which is intercut with verbal s second performance to an amazing effect however as is the nature of this half of the poem the film s amazing technical accomplishments are missing in this one for the most part except for a dazzling sequence where etzel s hall burns down with the nibelungs inside the one thing i do have to object to is the way harbou changes the ending spoilers in the poem after hildebrand captures hagen and gunther they are imprisoned kriemhild visits hagen in his cell and demands that he reveal where he has hidden the horde he refuses and she herself decapitates her brother when hagen still refuses she decapitates him hildebrand or possibly dietrich is so disgusted that a woman would presume to murder a great warrior that he in turn decapitates her calling her a devil woman etzel who is much weaker in the poem than he is here says something silly like ah me i can understand why they would want to keep a unity of time and place as hildebrand brings them from the castle to retain the prison settings of the two deaths would make the film very anticlimactic i also understand why they didn t have hildebrand kill kriemhild his character is much reduced here his name is only mentioned once but to have kriemhild kill herself adopting brynhild s death from the icelandic sources is just catering to the audience instead of challenging them the point of the poem is that kriemhild s wrath goes far beyond it should into the

personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its toll by the ending of the movie i had decided that this was a good thing when seven i though the relationship guff was a bad thing for an action film there is also plenty of gratifying gory action especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and hordes of

s gargantuan production of the nibelungen saga continues in the stylised symphonic and emotionally detached manner of its predecessor however whereas part one was a passionless portrayal of individual acts of heroism part two is a chaotic depiction of bloodletting on a grand scale as in part one director fritz lang maintains a continuous dynamic rhythm with the pace of the action and the complexity of the shot composition rising and falling smoothly as the tone of each scene demands these pictures should only be watched with the note perfect gottfried huppertz score which fortunately is on the kino dvd now with this focus on mass action lang is presented with greater challenges in staging the action sequences in his earliest features were often badly constructed but now he simply makes them part of that rhythmic flow with the level of activity on the screen swelling up like an orchestra but just as part one made us witness siegfried s adventures matter of factly and without excitement part two presents warfare as devastating tragedy in both pictures there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters that s why lang mostly keeps the camera outside of the action never allowing us to feel as if we are there and this is significant because involving the audience is normally a distinction of lang s work that s also why the performances are unnaturally theatrical with the actors lurching around like constipated sleepwalkers nevertheless kriemhild s revenge does constantly deal with emotions and is in fact profoundly humanist the one moment of naturalism is when atilla holds his baby son for the first time and lang actually emphasises the tenderness of this scene by building up to it with the wild frantic ride of the huns the point is that lang never manipulates us into taking sides and in that respect this version has more in common with the original saga than the wagner opera the climactic slaughter is the very antithesis of a rousing battle scene why then did hitler and co get so teary eyed over it a fact which has unfairly tarnished the reputation of these films because the unwavering racial ideology of the nazis made them automatically view the nibelungs as the good guys even if they do kill babies and betray their own kin for hitler their downfall would always be a nationalist tragedy not a human one but for us non nazi viewers what makes this picture enjoyable is its beautiful sense of pageantry and musical rhythm when you see these fully developed silent pictures of lang s it makes you realise how much he was wasted in hollywood rather than saddling him with low budget potboilers they should have put him to work on a few of those sword and sandal epics pictures that do not have to be believable and do not have to

not direct after this sci fi epic opera he and mr wells created but his film imagery sets and design are very recognizable that imagery is very effecting i recognized images from many other films that have paid homage to this classic the recent hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy is obvious along with bugs bunny fantasia monty python and the holy grail sky captain the world of tomorrow night of the living dead and more that i know of but which titles escape me this is real special effects here scenes now done with cgi are done with actors big sets and detailed models this film was made in and it s obvious it meant something to the other auteurs wells and menzies also worked with bliss doing the music and korda the producer to create a masterpiece with message warning and sermon the lines the

done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films this new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy return of the jedi often derided for its overly cute factor rotj is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect the empire strikes back indeed the cute element of rotj namely the ewoks remains a weak link in the entire series did george lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities only he can answer that question this cute factor aside the film is a brilliant full circle and evolution of the saga following on from the conclusion of the empire strikes back luke skywalker mark hamill follows his rebel alliance friends to tatooine his home planet to rescue han solo harrison ford the space pirate turned rebel hero who was captured by jabba the hutt for overdue debts skywalker is a changed man since leaving tatooine with ben obi wan kenobi alec guiness to fight the evil empire now swathed all in black luke s discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn his psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest while he might aim to always assist his rebel friends he yearns for another chance to confront the evil darth vader again despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the dark side and join vader at the emperor s side early scenes in tatooine are impressive from jabba s lair to his floating palace and the almighty sarlac an intenstine that lives in the sand lucas cgi enhancements to the film in actually worsened the overall effect of the sarlac making it look fake and overdone the battle scene on tatooine is outstanding and is one of the more memorable of the saga luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates jabba and his cronies proving his prowess as a jedi is now almost complete when luke returns to the degobah system to visit the ailing yoda one more time the viewer is let down by yoda s distinct lack of screentime undoubtably the star of the empire strikes back yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of luke s destiny is played out on screen rotj really is luke s film perhaps even more so than the original his journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with darth vader and his fate the other rebel characters certainly work in his shadow the romance between leia carrie fisher and solo is all but non existant unlike in empire in fact only leia s character is developed in rotj solo s character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films their roles are consigned to working alongside the rebels to destroy an all new death star that nears completion this time the emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction the empire intends to crush the rebellion once and for all while the emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful skywalker to his side to work alongside or is that replace darth vader the emperor is a different kind of evil for this film less cunning than governor tarkin peter cushing from star wars more deeply psychologically dark than anything else played brilliantly by ian mcdiarmid the emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate all the other actors are well entrenched in their roles hamill surprises as the more wisened luke making his character s progression from whiny teenager impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series ford s role is waring thin as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films he was the real star of the first film after all fisher s leia is more of a prop at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about add in favourites like alec guiness as kenobi yoda and the loveable chewbacca c po and r d

a young denzel washington kline plays donald woods a south africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist steve biko it starts as a difficult friendship for woods sees biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites but biko with his kind words upbeat attitude and complete transparency wins over woods and introduces him to a reality about apartheid that woods knew nothing about biko is a decent law abiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people one night coming from an illegal meeting he s arrested and beaten to death the authorities try to hush up the matter because biko has become a huge personality in south africa but through the efforts of woods the truth comes out but what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as woods and his family become targets for the secret police this movie has an interesting structure it has in fact two narratives first it narrates the life and death of biko it s an amazing first half completely dominated by the charisma of washington in what may be his greatest performance yet the second half no less interesting narrates woods attempt to escape from south africa to publish a book about biko woods has become an enemy of state a banned person which means he can t meet people or leave his country plus he s constantly spied by the police kevin kline gives a great performance in this second half too although the first half is quite straightforward the second does interesting things with editing by giving flashbacks of biko and of events that show the repression against the black south africans some may argue this is to make it more interesting but for me the second half just as captivating as woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape south africa the last minutes were so heartbreaking i was in tears george fenton and jonas gwangwa s score certainly had something to do with it although i ve never been much of a fan of fenton

the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi s take on tolkien s magnum opus the lord of the rings has actually been made by peter jackson the recent trilogy to me aren t even total masterpieces but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good sweeping entertainments but as one who has not read the books i end up now looking upon the two versions live action albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way and animated albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework in relation to just the basic story not even complete faithfulness to the books and with bakshi s version it s almost not fair in a way as what we do see is really not the complete vision not what jackson really had probably final cut robbed of return of the king s big climactic rush of the story and with the other two parts becoming rushed i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations though as such those same limitations make it disappointing what s interesting too after seeing the jackson films first which i also slightly regret being that i might ve reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkien s book is given some clarity in this section the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes are more or less adequate for the parts with a few parts standing out john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face value for those who ve not even seen the other films or read the books and can t put them into context but there is some level of interest always with the characters and here there s a more old fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more this is not a garden variety disney adaptation warts and all this is a bakshi film with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earth and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen in all its abbreviated form its hit or miss appeal along with being not totally complete as a film or as stories the form of the film is an experiment to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro but at the time of course was something that was a rough crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation in some parts yeah it does become a little noticeable as was also the case in bakshi s american pop that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky like some kind of comic book form done in a different way still there s much i admired in what was done the orcs for example i found to be really amazing in they re surreal surroundings they re maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live action especially during parts where there isn t battle footage that s really the real hit or miss section as there isn t continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback it s creepy in a good way and the backgrounds while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together it s almost something for art film buffs as much as for the ring nuts so how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings i don t know to tell the truth it s certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i ve seen the hobbit and i ve yet to see the animated rotk and there is some real artistry going on there s also some stilted dialog an all too rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness

live on the outskirts of larger cities i can t say that i m familiar with bucharest romania where the action unfolded but i have visited and lived in eastern europe for six months when i visited russia as a student for a semester my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the elevators weren t working but i do concur with the reviewer that the claustrophobia and muted colors it s overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks squares you can find in bucharest or in any historic city center of eastern europe and bucharest s didn t get much of any footage in this film for me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that i would feel during my half year stay there feeling trapped and limited it makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life just as people if hope to escape from a united states urban ghetto also given the climate of homophobia say circa us in the s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartment it s remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in romania and i find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing it s unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources the actors were fairly good and believable the dialog was overall well done and i could identity with these women the film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women kiki an energetic fun loving free spirit with a dark troubling secret her admiration and love for an abusive incestuous brother sandu falls in love with alexandra a bright bookish idealistic young woman who moves to bucharest to begin her college studies opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual alexandra and kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable though we don t get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other students hard to believe and the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed the chief threat to their love is kiki s brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him but kiki s love for alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it that s what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops and i won t say how it concludes ironically kiki s love sickness isn t love for another woman but her illicit incestuous love for her brother thus loving a woman

elevators flat screen panels and wireless intercoms it s probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future but it portrays a child like vision of boundless scientific technological

list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies it has a beautiful menzies art design but mediocre special effects esp the toy tanks i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the

its progress so it s also a story about the freedom to do science just as much as it s about the wonders of progress many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises except in cases of social bias many want to ban cloning for example or naturalism some don t want us to progress freely and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth

little film i m hesitant to call it a giallo because the film doesn t feature most of the things that make these films what they are but many genre entries break the mould and this would seem to be one of them the film doesn t feature any brutal murders as many giallo s do but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration the plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by julie his patient who for some reason she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her we then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before julie s arrival the film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth this never really comes off and i preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point if any the film is trying to make eye in the labyrinth is directed by mario caiano the director behind the excellent night of the doomed some years earlier he doesn t create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one but the surreal aspects of the story come off well and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring the film stars rosemary dexter who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance most of the rest of the cast aren t really worth mentioning with the exceptions of adolfo celi who is good as the villain of the piece and alida valli whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks the film does explain itself at the end which is lucky as i m sure i m not the only viewer who was

here the casting acting script and cinematography are all first rate for the moviegoer it s a moving violent story of love and human redemption for the film critic there s plenty of sharp technique and technical merit there are some tactical blunders and as has been discussed on the boards the ending lacks realism if one is rigorously formal with the cia agent training angle however i took the ending as being more moving due to the fact that rather than pursue the cia agent s pragmatic approach creasy basically commends his soul to the ultimate without considering the consequences like jesus himself creasy becomes superhuman through his sacrifice whether it actually makes pragmatic sense or not in any case i appreciated the fact that creasy dispenses with conventional bourgeois morality and just caps the bad guys one by one in his methodical quest for justice which actually results in redemption both for himself and the innocent in any case this film is very much worth

the emptiness and weaknesses of disney studios last productions here comes something that should heal your wounds once and for all a bug s life brings the proof that purely synthetic pictures

background and atmosphere are gone forever a bug s life pattes for my fellow french cinemaniaks succeeds in avoiding all the imperfections that make you awaken in the middle of the movie and say hey this thing is computer generated no weak parts a tremendous effort showing its efficiency in the backgrounds and the general look of the sets an astonishing d bird close to perfection in its imitation of reality and that s only to mention the technical aspects the scenario my friends the real backbone of a motion picture has some thickness curiously and obviously thanks to lasseter s team there is practically no musical sequence in a bug s life which means the story is long and rich enough to free itself from these or minutes that some kids appreciate but most others dislike same thing for the parents or the anime fans like me this movie reminded me of a really old movie featuring steve martin and chevy chase the amigos it had basically the same background story a whole mexican village living in the fear of a few bad guys hires gunmen who finally turn to be actors to protect them etc simple but efficient and brilliantly adapted to a colony of frightened ants facing the wrath of vicious insects since microcosmos many movies tell tales of insects their lives fears and hopes but i do think that a bug s life is the funniest and best directed of all the humanisation process has been perfectly well achieved and the whole audience was captivated by flik s aka tilt in france adventures a big thank you for lasseter s team especially for the last seconds it s so strange and great
